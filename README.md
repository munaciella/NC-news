Welcome to NC News!
Two files are added into the .gitignore file:
.env.development
.env.test
To replicate this on your pc, you can do the following steps:
1. Create a .env.test file and a .env.development file
2. In the setup.sql file there are two commands CREATE and DROP
3. Add the relevent commands into the relevant file i.e CREATE server, DROP server
